## System Architecture

UniPay is structured as a single-page application (SPA) with a clear separation between its backend and frontend components.

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend features a modern, Revolut-inspired interface, built with `shadcn/ui` (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS). Key design elements include a fixed top navigation, a fully responsive collapsible left sidebar, a modern color palette with violet/indigo gradients and pastel accents, card-based layouts, Framer Motion for animations, and a gradient balance card with quick action buttons. `DashboardLayout` is used for authenticated users and `AuthLayout` for unauthenticated users.

**Key UI/UX Features:**
*   **Responsive Collapsible Sidebar:** Universally available, responsive widths, touch-friendly controls, smooth Framer Motion animations, persistent state via Zustand, and full accessibility.
*   **Dialog/Popup Scrolling Pattern:** Standardized scrollable pattern for all dialogs to ensure proper viewport fitting.
*   **Consistent Transaction Color Coding:** Universal color system for transaction icons and amounts across all views: incoming transactions/balance increases use green icons, outgoing transactions/balance decreases use red/danger icons.
*   **Dashboard Balance Card:** Premium digital bank card design with authentic 7:4 aspect ratio, enhanced maximum width, strict boundary containment, fully percent-based positioning, proportionally scaling typography, action buttons anchored to bottom with proportional spacing, enhanced depth with layered shadows, diagonal gradient background with glassmorphic overlays, subtle decorative elements, animated shimmer effect, EMV chip and wallet branding icons, and responsive blur effects.
*   **Activity/Transactions Page Layout:** Responsive layout with two-column grid for large screens where calendar and vertically centered statistics cards sit side-by-side in the top row, and All Transactions dropdown spans full width below. Mobile and tablet devices maintain a stacked layout.
*   **Comprehensive Fluid Design System:** Fully responsive design using `CSS clamp()` for seamless scaling of typography, spacing, and components across all viewport sizes, eliminating breakpoint-specific overrides and ensuring consistent visual language. All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Technical Implementations
*   **Backend:** Flask (Python), SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL), Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication, Flask-SocketIO for real-time features. Utilizes an Application Factory Pattern and Flask Blueprints for modularity, with security measures like JWT, password hashing, PIN protection, and CORS.
*   **Frontend:** React 18 and Vite. State management via Zustand (client-side) and TanStack Query (server-side). Axios for HTTP requests with JWT interceptors, and React Router DOM for navigation.

**Core Feature Specifications:**
*   **Authentication:** User registration, login, JWT token management, PIN setup/change, and visual-only features for forgot password and social login.
*   **Wallet:** Balance display, top-up, peer-to-peer transfers, and multi-currency support with transfer scheduling.
*   **Transactions:** Comprehensive tracking, filtering, and statistical analysis for 15+ types, including "expected payments" (CRUD, recurring), balance validation, race condition protection, detailed records, and automatic query invalidation.
*   **Virtual Cards:** Creation, management (freeze/unfreeze), linking to subscriptions, and payment checks.
*   **Subscriptions:** Management of recurring payments.
*   **Savings & Goals:** Dedicated goal tracking with progress indicators, contributions, editable targets, and completion celebrations.
*   **DarkDays Pocket:** Secure, PIN-protected savings pockets with auto-save options, consolidated settings, and emergency withdrawal flow with security verification.
*   **Marketplace:** Student-to-student commerce with listings and escrow services, buyer balance validation, and dual transaction recording.
*   **P2P Lending:** Request-approval system with distinct tabs, approval workflow, summary statistics, full loan lifecycle tracking, role-based actions, visual indicators, and robust security.
*   **ISIC Discounts:** Integration for student card-based discounts.
*   **Security Settings:** PIN management, visual-only features for email verification, 2FA, active sessions, rate limiting, and session timeout.
*   **Notifications:** Comprehensive toast notification system and optimized UI dialogs for various screen sizes.

### System Design Choices
*   **Database Schema:** Core entities include Users, Wallets, Transactions, VirtualCards, Subscriptions, SavingsPockets, Goals, Marketplace (Listings, Orders), Loans, Repayments, and ISIC models.
*   **API Design:** RESTful API with logically organized endpoints and proper HTTP status codes.
*   **Development Workflow:** Supports concurrent backend (Python) and frontend (Node.js) development with API proxying. Flask-Migrate (Alembic) for database migrations.
