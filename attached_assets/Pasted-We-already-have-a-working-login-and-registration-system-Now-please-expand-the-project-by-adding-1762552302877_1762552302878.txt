We already have a working login and registration system.

Now, please expand the project by adding **basic database models, routes, and placeholder pages** for the core functionalities of a Digital Wallet App (UniPay).

Use a clean modular structure (React frontend + Node/Express backend + SQLite/PostgreSQL as DB).

---

🧩 BACKEND (API + MODELS)

Create the following base models (with example fields):

1. **User** (existing)
   - id, name, email, password, phone, isicLinked, balance, createdAt

2. **Wallet**
   - id, userId (FK)
   - balance (float)
   - currency (string, default "BGN")
   - createdAt, updatedAt

3. **Transaction**
   - id, walletId (FK)
   - type: "incoming" | "outgoing"
   - amount, description, category
   - date, status

4. **Card**
   - id, userId (FK)
   - type: "debit" | "virtual" | "subscription"
   - cardNumber (mock)
   - expiry, cvv (mock)
   - status: "active" | "blocked"
   - createdAt

5. **Subscription**
   - id, userId (FK)
   - name (e.g., "Spotify", "Netflix")
   - amount, billingCycle ("monthly")
   - nextPaymentDate
   - status ("active" | "paused" | "failed")
   - totalPaid
   - createdAt

6. **DarkDaysPocket**
   - id, userId (FK)
   - percentage (float)
   - amountSaved (float)
   - lockedUntil (date)
   - status ("locked" | "unlocked")

7. **ISICPartner**
   - id, name, type ("food", "books", "sports", etc.)
   - onlineID, posID, discountPercent
   - lastSynced

8. **MarketplaceItem**
   - id, userId (seller)
   - title, description, category
   - price, fileURL
   - status ("active" | "sold")

9. **Goal**
   - id, userId (FK)
   - title, targetAmount, currentAmount
   - deadline, progress (%)

10. **Loan**
    - id, lenderId, borrowerId (FKs)
    - amount, status ("active" | "paid" | "pending")
    - dateIssued, dueDate

🧭 ROUTES (API endpoints)

Please create REST routes with placeholders for each main feature:
- `/api/wallet` → get balance, top-up, transfer
- `/api/transactions` → CRUD
- `/api/cards` → list, create, deactivate
- `/api/subscriptions` → list, add, update status
- `/api/darkdays` → manage savings pocket
- `/api/isic` → link ISIC, get partners, check discount
- `/api/marketplace` → list, create, buy item
- `/api/goals` → create, update, view goals
- `/api/loans` → create, track, repay

For now, implement mock JSON responses (no real logic yet).
Use Express Router and group endpoints by feature.

---

🎨 FRONTEND (React)

Create base pages (placeholder components with titles, icons, and short descriptions):

- `/dashboard` → show user balance + quick buttons
- `/wallet` → mock wallet info
- `/cards` → list mock cards
- `/subscriptions` → mock subscription list
- `/darkdays` → mock pocket info
- `/isic` → ISIC link + mock partner list
- `/marketplace` → mock list of items
- `/goals` → mock goal tracker
- `/loans` → mock list of debts/loans
- `/transactions` → list sample transactions

Each page should display “Coming soon…” or mock data using Tailwind + Card components.

Add them all to the sidebar / top navigation so they’re accessible.

💾 DATABASE

If using SQLite (for simplicity):
- Generate migrations for each model
- Create seed data for a test user and a few transactions, cards, etc.

🎯 Objective

✅ Working skeleton for all core functionalities  
✅ Modular routes + models ready for expansion  
✅ Placeholder UI pages for each section  
✅ Ready to connect real logic later
