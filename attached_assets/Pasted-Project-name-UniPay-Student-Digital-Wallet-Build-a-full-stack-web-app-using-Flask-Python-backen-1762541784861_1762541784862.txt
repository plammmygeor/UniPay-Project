Project name: UniPay — Student Digital Wallet

Build a full-stack web app using Flask (Python backend) and Vite + React (frontend).
The project will simulate a modern digital wallet for students, combining core payment functions with unique features designed for student life.
Use Tailwind CSS for styling and provide a simple but modern UI suitable for a live demo during a hackathon.

🔹 Core Functionalities (MVP)

Authentication (email / social login)

Allow users to sign up and log in with email, password, or simulated social login.

Use Flask session or mock JWT tokens for authentication.

Include simple validation and logout.

Digital Wallet with Balance and Transactions

Each user has a main wallet with current balance.

Enable mock transfer of funds (send/receive) between users.

Display full transaction history (date, amount, type, status).

Include “Add Funds” simulation (bank transfer, card, QR).

Virtual Cards (basic + subscription cards)

Each user can generate virtual debit cards.

Support a second card type: Subscription Card.

Allow adding predefined subscriptions (Spotify, Netflix, YouTube Premium, etc.) and custom ones.

Automatic recurring payments every period (simulated).

Status: active, paused, awaiting payment.

Show total spent, next payment date, and reminders for failed or upcoming payments.

DarkDays Pocket (Secure Savings Sub-Wallet)

A separate locked “savings pocket” for emergencies.

Automatically transfers a chosen percentage (e.g. 20%) from income into this pocket.

Locked with 2-layer security (PIN + confirm popup).

Only balance viewable, withdrawal requires unlock.

Option “Emergency Unlock”.

Generate monthly report: “You saved X in Y months.”

ISIC Student Discount Integration (Mock)

Simulate connecting a student’s ISIC profile.

On each transaction, detect known merchant names (e.g., “KFC”, “McDonald’s”, “Storytel”) from a mock DB.

If a match is found → display message “You have a student discount here!”

Add “Show ISIC Card” button in UI.

Create both Online (by domain) and Physical (by merchant ID) mock detections.

Financial Goals Tracker (Piggy Goals)

Allow users to create multiple saving goals (e.g., “Laptop Fund”).

Manual transfers from main wallet to each goal.

Progress bar + percentage display.

Notify when goal is reached (“Unlocked Goal!” animation with confetti).

Simple P2P Lending Between Students

Users can request or offer small loans (simulated).

Add borrower/lender info, amount, and due date.

Keep a “Debt Tracker” showing who owes whom and how much.

Allow marking loans as “Repaid” and track repayment history.

Include reminder notifications for due loans.

🔹 Technical Requirements

Backend: Flask REST API (Python 3.10+), structured with routes/, models/, controllers/, and db.py.

Database: SQLite for simplicity.

Frontend: Vite + React, styled with Tailwind CSS.

Routing (frontend): Login, Dashboard, Wallet, Subscriptions, DarkDays, ISIC, Goals, Loans.

Provide mock endpoints and JSON data for demo use (no real payments).

Include at least one pre-seeded demo user for live demo (e.g., student@unipay.com, password 1234).

Use Flask Blueprints for modularity (auth_routes.py, wallet_routes.py, etc.).

Run with one "Run" button in Replit — no manual build or external setup.
