We already have authentication (login + register). 
Now, let’s build the **visual skeleton and component structure** for all core MVP wallet features.

Goal:
Create a clean, Revolut-style UI layout using React + Tailwind. 
Top-left → user avatar + profile/settings dropdown.  
Main layout → sidebar (menu) + main content panel.  
Keep it responsive and simple.

### 🧩 MVP FUNCTIONALITIES (Frontend focus)

For each feature below:
- Add a visible **menu item / navigation link**
- Create a **dedicated folder** under `src/features/<featureName>/`
- Inside each folder, create:
  - `index.jsx` (main page / component)
  - `FeatureCard.jsx` (subcomponent or visual element)
  - `feature.config.js` (for future logic or mock data)
- If the feature already exists → check it, keep or refactor for consistency.

### 🎨 UI STYLE

- Use **Tailwind** + **shadcn/ui** for cards, buttons, inputs
- Inspired by **Revolut dashboard**
- Minimalistic, glassy panels, rounded corners, shadow-lg
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Sidebar menu icons (Home, Wallet, Cards, Subscriptions, Goals, etc.)
- Each feature page should say: “Feature ready for development” + placeholder mock data

---

### ✅ Objective

- Verify which MVP features already exist (account + auth)
- Create visual placeholder for all others
- Ensure sidebar + routing links to each one
- Keep everything modular (one folder per feature)
- No backend logic yet – just UI components and mock content
