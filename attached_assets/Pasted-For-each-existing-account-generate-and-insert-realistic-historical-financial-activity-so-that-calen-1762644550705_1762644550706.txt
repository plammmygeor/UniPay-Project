For each existing account, generate and insert realistic historical financial activity so that calendar views, account statements and dashboard banking cards show consistent past transactions and updated balances.

Scope

Use only existing accounts — do not create new user accounts.

Apply history for every account provided in the list.

Time range & volume

Populate activity covering the past 6 months (relative to today) by default.

Create approximately 3–4 transactions per week total, distributed across accounts. Ensure every active account receives at least a few transactions across the period (aim for 1–10 per account).

Distribute transactions across weekdays and weekends; some days may have none, some days may have several.

Transaction types

Internal transfers: money moved between two existing accounts (use real sender and receiver accounts from the system).

Inbound payments (income): funds credited to an account from an external source (label as external income).

Outbound payments (expense): funds debited from an account to an external payee (label as external expense).

Mix types so history looks natural (e.g., some accounts receive mostly incomes, some mostly expenses, some both).

Amounts and realism

Use amounts that are plausible relative to the account balances: typical transactions between $5 and $500, with occasional larger amounts up to $1,000.

Ensure every generated debit has a matching credit (for internal transfers). For external flows, record clear notes that the counterparty is external.

Avoid producing negative balances unless overdrafts are explicitly supported by the system; if a debit would overdraw an account, choose a different payer or skip/reschedule that transaction.

Precise timestamps & calendar integration

Each transaction must include a precise timestamp (date and time).

Ensure every generated transaction appears as an event in the calendar on its date/time with a clear label (example labels: “Sent $45.00 to demo@test.com
 — Transfer”, “Received $120.00 from alice@student.com
 — Income”, “Paid $20.00 for Coffee — Expense”).

Clicking a calendar event must open or link to the transaction detail view.

Write to authoritative sources & consistency

Insert the transactions into the system’s authoritative place for transaction history so all interfaces (statements, dashboard cards, calendar, APIs) reflect the changes. Do not only write to temporary or test-only storage.

Recompute and persist account balances so the dashboard cards and account views show balances consistent with the newly created history.

If the system uses caching, read-replicas, or other layers, ensure caches are invalidated or data is refreshed so updates are visible immediately.

Auditability & reversibility

Tag every generated record distinctly (e.g., include a clear generator tag or marker) so generated items can be identified and removed if necessary.

Keep an audit trail for each inserted transaction recording: a unique transaction identifier, affected account(s), amount, type (internal/inbound/outbound), timestamp, human- or agent-actor who performed the insertion, and the generator tag.

Provide a reversible plan or a way to remove the generated transactions (for example: a script or filter that deletes only records with the generator tag).

Idempotency

Ensure the process is idempotent or guarded so repeated runs do not duplicate transactions. Check for existing generated records before inserting duplicates.

Outputs & verification

After completion produce a machine-readable export (CSV or JSON) containing every created transaction with these readable fields: unique transaction identifier, date_time, debit account (or “external”), credit account (or “external”), amount, currency, type (transfer/income/expense), short description, generator tag.

Also provide a per-account summary: account identifier, starting balance before inserts, total debits added, total credits added, ending balance after inserts.

Provide a short human-readable report summarizing: total transactions created, number of accounts affected, any skipped items and why, and confirmation that calendar and dashboard views now show the history.

Safety & production

Do not run writes against a production environment without explicit, documented confirmation from an authorized person. If allowed to run in production, require an explicit confirmation flag.

If running in a non-production or staging environment, proceed but still log all changes and produce the reversible cleanup plan.

Presentation requirements

Calendar events must show readable labels and link to transaction details.

Account statements and dashboard cards must reflect the new balances and list the recent transactions in chronological order.

The generated history should look natural: varying amounts, a mix of transaction types, occasional larger transactions, and realistic timestamps.
