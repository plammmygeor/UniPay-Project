Please extend the Calendar functionality in the Activity section with an interactive feature for managing upcoming (expected) payments.
This feature should allow users to add, edit, and manage expected payments directly from specific dates in the calendar view.

Functional Requirements:

Add “Add Expected Payment” option:

When a user clicks on a date (past or future), a small modal or pop-up should appear with an option labeled “Add Expected Payment”.

This allows the user to define a future payment that is expected on that specific date.

Payment Details Form:
The pop-up should include:

Title/Description (e.g., “Dorm Rent”, “Electricity Bill”, “Spotify Subscription”)

Amount (positive number)

Category/Type (e.g., Housing, Utilities, Subscription, Other)

Frequency options:

One-time (default)

Repeat monthly (on the same date each month)

Repeat weekly (on the same weekday)

Optional Notes field.

Display & Visualization:

Once saved, the date in the calendar should be highlighted according to the color legend for upcoming payments (🟡 yellow).

Hovering or clicking the highlighted date should show a quick summary (title + amount).

If multiple expected payments exist for the same date, show a compact summary (e.g., “3 payments scheduled”) and expand on click.

Synchronization:

Expected payments should be stored persistently, just like regular transactions.

If the expected date passes, they should automatically move to the “past” section and appear as completed or pending confirmation in the transaction history.

UX/UI Suggestion:

Keep the design clean and aligned with the rest of the dashboard (rounded corners, soft shadows, minimal fields).

Ideally, allow adding expected payments via both the calendar click and a dedicated button near the top of the Activity section for convenience.

Example use cases:

Adding a monthly rent payment on the 21st of each month.

Scheduling a one-time water bill for November 17.

Setting up a recurring Spotify subscription charge on the 15th of each month.

After implementing, please make sure all newly added expected payments appear properly highlighted in the calendar and can be edited or deleted by the user.
