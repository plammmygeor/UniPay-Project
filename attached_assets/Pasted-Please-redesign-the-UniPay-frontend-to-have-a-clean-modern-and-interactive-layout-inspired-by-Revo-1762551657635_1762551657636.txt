Please redesign the UniPay frontend to have a clean, modern, and interactive layout inspired by Revolut’s app design.

Goal:
Keep all existing functionality (dashboard, wallet, cards, savings, etc.) but make the UI more intuitive, organized, and visually appealing — with a sleek fintech look and smooth navigation.

Requirements:
1. **Top Navigation Bar**
   - Add a fixed top bar with:
     - Profile picture (left)
     - App logo or "UniPay" title (center)
     - Settings icon (right)
   - Clicking the profile picture should open a small dropdown with:
     - "My Profile"
     - "Settings"
     - "Logout"

2. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Replace current layout with a clean card-based interface:
     - Large balance card at the top (showing available balance)
     - Quick action buttons (Top-up, Transfer, Add Card)
     - Recent transactions below in a scrollable list
   - Use gradients, shadows, and rounded corners like Revolut
   - Add subtle hover effects and motion for interactivity

3. **Sidebar / Bottom Menu**
   - Replace the current cluttered navigation with a sleek sidebar or bottom navigation bar (depending on screen size):
     - Dashboard 🏠
     - Wallet 💰
     - Cards 💳
     - Savings 🐖
     - Marketplace 🛍️
     - Loans 🤝
     - Profile 👤
   - On mobile view, make it a bottom tab bar with icons only

4. **Color Palette & Style**
   - Minimalistic white background with pastel accent colors
   - Use soft blues, purples, and gradients similar to Revolut
   - Consistent typography with clear hierarchy (headings, labels, balances)

5. **Interactivity**
   - Add smooth animations (Framer Motion)
   - Hover and press effects for buttons
   - Loading skeletons for pages
   - Animated transitions when switching pages

6. **Responsiveness**
   - Ensure all layouts look great on both desktop and mobile
   - Use grid and flex layouts to adapt dynamically

7. **Profile Page**
   - Show user info: name, email, university, ISIC status
   - Add buttons to edit profile and change PIN
   - Include small “Achievements” or “Goals progress” widgets (optional)

8. **Implementation details**
   - Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui components
   - You can use Framer Motion for animations
   - Keep the project under the `src/features` structure (React + Vite)
   - Don’t remove existing API connections — just redesign the UI layout

Expected outcome:
✅ Modern Revolut-like design  
✅ Intuitive navigation (less cluttered)  
✅ Interactive dashboard  
✅ Responsive on desktop & mobile  
✅ Profile dropdown and top bar navigation
